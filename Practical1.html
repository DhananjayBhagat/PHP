            <p>The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It
                was supposed to be made entirely of stone but after the completion of the base floor or the first story,
                the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj(King) saying that
                a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the king himself and not the Peshwas. Following
                this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made
                of brick and not stone. Even today if you visit and see the walls carefully, they are partly made of
                stone and partly by bricks. The Wada was then completed and upon being attacked by the British Artillery
                90 years later, all the top six stories collapsed leaving only the stone base, which was immune to the
                British artillery. Hence only the stone base of the Shaniwar Wada remains and can be seen even today in
                the older parts of Pune. </p><br>

            <p>The Aga Khan Palace was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III in the city of Pune, India.

                The palace was an act of charity by the spiritual leader of the Nizari Ismaili Muslims, who wanted to
                help the poor in the neighbouring areas of Pune, who were drastically hit by famine by offering them
                work.[1][2]

                The Aga Khan Palace is a majestic building.[3] The palace is closely linked to the Indian freedom
                movement as it served as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi, his secretary Mahadev
                Desai and Sarojini Naidu. It is also the place where Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai died.[3] In 2003,
                Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) declared the site as a monument of national importance.[4] Aga Khan
                Palace is major attraction of photographers for various kind of photo shoot because of its special
                architecture, greenery and perfect for photography lighting. </p><br>

        <p>Shrimant Dagadusheth Halwai and his wife Laxmibai was a trader and sweet maker settled in Pune. His original
            halwai shop still exists under the name "Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets" near Datta Mandir in Pune. Eventually he
            became a successful sweet seller and a rich businessman. In the later 1800s, they lost their only son in a
            plague epidemic. They were approached by a compassionate sage who advised them to build a Ganesha temple in
            Pune.[6]

            Later, as they did not have any heir, Dagdusheth adopted his nephew Govindsheth (born 1865) who was 9 years
            old at the time of their death. Govindsheth was born in 1891 in Pune. He replaced the first Ganesh idol by a
            new one, with the first one still being present at Akra Maruti Chowk. A kind-hearted and generous man, he
            established one more Ganesh idol in wrestlers training center, which is called Jagoba Dada Talim. This talim
            was owned by Dagdusheth as he was also a former wrestling trainer. One of the chowk (area) in Pune is named
            Govind Halwai Chowk, after him. Along with his mother, Govindsheth handled all the programmes like Ganesh
            Utsav, Datta Jayanti and other festivities. The residence where they resided is now known as Laxmibai
            Dagdusheth Halwai Sansthan Datta Mandir Trust. Laxmi Road in Pune is named after Laxmibai Dagdusheth halwai.

        <p>Okayama Friendship Garden This is a very popular Japanese garden in the city of Pune. The garden was inspired
            by the 300-year-old Okayama's Koraku-en Garden, hence it is also called the Pune-Okayama Friendship Garden.
            Situated in Dattawadi, this garden is an extraordinary amalgamation of concrete and natural beauty.

            The garden has a natural canal that runs across the garden while the ponds and springs present here are
            man-made. From lush gardens to enchanting flowers, wonderful landscapes and colorful seating areas, Okayama
            Friendship Garden will invigorate your soul and make your five senses work over time.</p><br>
